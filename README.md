# 3D-Printed-Prosthetic
A side project from when I was majoring in Biomedical Engineering to incorporate prosthetics with AI. Having the ability to 3D Print a prosthetic for both a person and a robot fascinated me. These files display that idea. Still a work in progress; soon to include continuous servos controlled via Arduino and a battery.
